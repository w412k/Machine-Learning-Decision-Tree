# Titanic Passengers Survivability Prediction

This repository contains a practice exercise for predicting Titanic passengers' survivability using a machine learning decision tree model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this exercise is a made-up dataset about Titanic survivors. It includes various features of the passengers, such as age, gender, class, and other relevant information. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for training the prediction model.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an individual is likely to survive the Titanic disaster based on the provided features. By exploring and analyzing the dataset, we aim to build an effective decision tree model for this prediction task.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset file used for training the model.
- `notebook/`: This directory includes the Jupyter Notebook file (`predict_survivability.ipynb`) that contains the code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.
